["Chapter 1 - Relations and Functions Definitions: Let A and B be two non-empty sets, then a function f from set A to set B is a rule which associates each element of A to a unique element of B. o Relation If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as a R b o Function It is represented as f: A → B and function is also called mapping. o Real Function f: A → B is called a real function, if A and B are subsets of R. o Domain and Codomain of a Real Function Domain and codomain of a function f is a set of all real numbers x for which f(x) is a real number. Here, set A is domain and set B is codomain. o Range of a real function f is a set of values f(x) which it attains on the points of its domain Types of Relations o A relation R in a set A is called Empty relation , if no element of A is related to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A. o A relation R in a set A is called Universal relation , if each element of A is related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A. o Both the empty relation and the universal relation are sometimes called Trivial Relations o A relation R in a set A is called ▪ Reflexive ▪ if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A, ▪ Symmetric ▪ If (a 1 , a 2 ) ∈ R implies that (a 2 , a 1 ) ∈ R, for all a 1 , a 2 ∈ A. ▪ Transitive ▪ If (a 1 , a 2 ) ∈ R and (a 2 , a 3 ) ∈ R implies that (a 1 , a 3 ) ∈ R, for all a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ∈ A. o A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive o The set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of Z satisfying following conditions: ▪ All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to each other. ▪ No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa. ▪ E and O are disjoint and Z = E ∪ O. ▪ The subset E is called the equivalence class containing zero, Denoted by [0]. ▪ O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]. ","o Note ▪ [0] ≠ [1] ▪ [0] = [2r] ▪ [1] = [2r + 1], r ∈ Z. o Given an arbitrary equivalence relation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets Ai called partitions or subdivisions of X satisfying: ▪ All elements of Ai are related to each other, for all i. ▪ No element of Ai is related to any element of Aj, i ≠ j. ▪ ⋃ A j = X and A i ∩ A j = φ , i ≠ j. o The subsets A i are called equivalence classes. Note : o Two ways of representing a relation ▪ Roaster method ▪ Set builder method o If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b . Types of Functions Consider the functions f 1 , f 2 , f 3 and f 4 given • A function f: X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective ), if the images of distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x 1 , x 2 ∈ X, f(x 1 ) = f(x 2 ) implies x 1 = x 2 . Otherwise, f is called many-one. Example o One- One Function o Many-One Function • A function f: X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective) , if every element of Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an element x in X such that f(x) = y. ","o f: X → Y is onto if and only if Range of f = Y. o Eg: • A function f: X → Y is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is both one-one and onto. o Eg: Composition of Functions and Invertible Function Composite Function • Let f: A → B and g: B → C be two functions. • Then the composition of f and g, denoted by g o f , is defined as the function g o f : A → C given by g o f(x) = g (f(x)), ∀ x ∈ A. • Eg: o Let f : {2, 3, 4, 5} → {3, 4, 5, 9} and g : {3, 4, 5, 9} → {7, 11, 15} be functions o Defined as f (2) = 3, f (3) = 4, f (4) = f (5) = 5 and g (3) = g (4) = 7 and g (5) = g (9) = 11. o Find g o f. o Solution ▪ g o f(2) = g (f(2)) = g (3) = 7, ▪ g o f (3) = g (f(3)) = g (4) = 7, ▪ g o f (4) = g (f(4)) = g (5) = 11 and ▪ g o f (5) = g (5) = 11 • It can be verified in general that gof is one-one implies that f is one-one. Similarly, gof is onto implies that g is onto. ","• While composing f and g, to get gof, first f and then g was applied, while in the reverse process of the composite gof, first the reverse process of g is applied and then the reverse process of f. • If f: X → Y is a function such that there exists a function g: Y → X such that gof = IX and fog = IY, then f must be one-one and onto. Invertible Function • A function f: X → Y is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function g: Y → X such that gof = IX and fog = IY. The function g is called the inverse of f • Denoted by f – 1 . • Thus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely, if f is one-one and onto, then f must be invertible. Theorem 1 • If f : X → Y, g : Y → Z and h : Z → S are functions, then o h o (g o f) = (h o g) o f. • Proof We have o h o (g o f) (x) = h(g o f (x)) = h(g(f(x))), ∀ x in X o (h o g) o f (x) = h o g (f(x)) = h (g (f(x))), ∀ x in X. Hence, h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f Theorem 2 • Let f: X → Y and g: Y → Z be two invertible functions. o Then gof is also invertible with (g o f) -1 = f -1 o g -1 • Proof o To show that gof is invertible with (g o f) -1 = f -1 o g -1 , it is enough to show that (f -1 o g -1 ) o (g o f) = I X and (g o f) o (f -1 o g -1 ) = I Z . Now, (f – 1 o g – 1 ) o (g o f) = ((f – 1 o g – 1 ) o g) of, by Theorem 1 = (f -1 o (g -1 o g)) of, by Theorem 1 = (f -1 o I Y ) of, by definition of g – 1 = I X Similarly, it can be shown that (g o f) o (f -1 o g -1 ) = I Z Binary Operations Definitions: • A binary operation ∗ on a set A is a function ∗ : A × A → A. We denote ∗ (a, b) by a ∗ b. ","• A binary operation ∗ on the set X is called commutative, if a ∗ b = b ∗ a, for every a, b ∈ X • A binary operation ∗ : A × A → A is said to be associative if (a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ (b ∗ c), ∀ a, b, c, ∈ A. • A binary operation ∗ : A × A → A, an element e ∈ A, if it exists, is called identity for the operation ∗ , if a ∗ e = a = e ∗ a, ∀ a ∈ A. ▪ Zero is identity for the addition operation on R but it is not identity for the addition operation on N, as 0 ∉ N. ▪ Addition operation on N does not have any identity. ▪ For the addition operation + : R × R → R, given any a ∈ R, there exists – a in R such that a + ( – a) = 0 (identity for ‘+’) = (– a) + a. ▪ For the multiplication operation on R, given any a ≠ 0 in R, we can choose 1 𝑎 such that a X 1 𝑎 = 1 (identity for ‘×’) = 1 = 1 𝑎 X a • A binary operation ∗ : A × A → A with the identity element e in A, an element a ∈ A is said to be invertible with respect to the operation ∗ , if there exists an element b in A such that a ∗ b = e = b ∗ a and b is called the inverse of a and is denoted by a -1 ","g159 uni0078uni003Duni0073uni0069uni006E g84 g159 uni0078 uni0063uni006Funi0073 uni0032 g83 g167 g183 g32 g16g84 g168 g184 g169 g185 g159

Applications The below are the uses of matrices: • Compact and simple methods of solving system of linear equations. • Used as a representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations • Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an experiment etc. • Used in physical operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through a plane • Used in cryptography. • Also used in various branches of sciences like genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial management. • Used in 3D math, where they are primarily used to describe the relationship between two coordinate spaces. Matrix • Definition: A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers (may be real or complex) or functions. • Elements or Entries of the matrix: The numbers or functions in the array • Rows of Matrix: The horizontal lines of elements • Columns of Matrix: The vertical lines of elements • General Format: o Simple Matrix: ▪ Has one Row and Column ▪ Represented as (Row, Column) o Higher Level Matrix ▪ Has many Rows and Columns ▪ Represented as below: A = [ 𝑎 11 𝑎 12 𝑎 13………. 𝑎 1𝑛 𝑎 21 𝑎 22 𝑎 23 ……𝑎 2𝑛 𝑎 31 𝑎 32 𝑎 33 …… 𝑎 3𝑛 ] (or) A = ( 𝑎 11 𝑎 12 𝑎 13………. 𝑎 1𝑛 𝑎 21 𝑎 22 𝑎 23 ……𝑎 2𝑛 𝑎 31 𝑎 32 𝑎 33 …… 𝑎 3𝑛 ) Rows Columns ▪ Furthermore, Generalized format is as below: ","11 12 13 1 1 2 21 22 23 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... j n j n ij i i i in mn m m m mj mn a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a                      (Or ) A= [ a ij ] m x n Where, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n and i, j € N • i th Row Elements are a i1, a i2, a i3, ……… a in • j th Row Elements are a 1j, a 2j, a 3j ………………, a nj Order of a Matrix • If a matrix has “m” rows and “n” columns, then order of the matrix is m x n • The total numbers of elements in the matrix of m x n will be mn • Eg: Order of the below matrix is 3 x 2 A = [ 3 2 4 1 5 9 ] With total number of elements = product of 3 and 2 = 6 • Any point (x,y) in a plane can be represented in the matrix format as below: P = [ x, y] or [ ? ? ] • Suppose if the vertices of a Quadrilateral ABCD are given then it can be represented as matrix format as below Points: A(1,0) , B(3,2), C(1,3) and D(-1,-2) 24 42 1 0 1 3 1 1 3 2 or 0 2 3 2 1 3 1 2                         A A BC D B X Y C D • Suppose if the matrix has 8 elements then all possible order of the matrix can be found as below. o Find the Factors of 8  1, 2, 4, 8 o Pair up them in all possible ways  (1,8), (2, 4), (8,1), (4, 2) Types of a Matrix 1.
